CS6083 Problem Set 3
Shang-Hung Tsai

Problem 1:

There are three php files in this folder:
    index.php - This is the main page of restaurant booking website, where users can search for restaurants.
    query.php - This file returns a lists of available restaurants that matches user's search.
    reserve.php - This file creates a booking for the restaurant the user selects, and prints a list of user's recent bookings.

I am using Ubuntu for the development of this small project.

To run my code, first make sure you have LAMP stack installed already.
Then place the above files to /var/www/ so that they are on localhost.
Then open up a browser and go to "localhost/index.php".
